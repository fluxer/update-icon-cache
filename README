This is a standalone version of gtk-update-icon-cache extracted from the GTK+
toolkit sources, the changes made to it simply remove the GTK+ dependency thus
making it usable for projects that to not want to depend on the whole GTK+
toolkit for the sake of having this tool, not at build nor at runtime.
